Install Python using Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

We will be using the Jupyter Notebook (via jupyter lab) which is pre-installed with the Anaconda distribution

Getting the data:

1. If you know git, you can `clone` this repository.
2. If you do not know git, there is a green "Clone or download" button on the top of the page.
  You can click "Download ZIP" to download the contents of this project (including the datasets).

## Test your installation

If you can run the following lines in Python without error, you should be good to go

```python
import pandas as pd
